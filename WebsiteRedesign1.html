            <p>Our dogs  have come for many, varied reasons.  Some have medical issues, some have behavioral challenges, some are older, senior dogs and some just ran out of time at a shelter and would have been put down if they had not come here.</p>
                
            <p>Dogs who have challenges that prevent them from being adopted can live out their lives here at the farm in safety and peace, where no one will bother them and they will not be in danger of being put down, just for being who they are.</p>
                
            <p>Some dogs who came here labeled "unadoptable" have been able to have families after spending time with us here at the farm and learning to trust people.</p>
